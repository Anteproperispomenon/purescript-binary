# purescript-binary

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Unisay/purescript-binary.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Unisay/purescript-binary)

The idea behind this library is to provide a bit-manipulation primitives together with type classes
that capture isomorphism between your custom types and arrays of bits.

Additionally, library provides [Un]signed integer types of a size fixed at the type level:
- [x] Data.Binary.UnsignedInt
- [x] Data.Binary.SignedInt
